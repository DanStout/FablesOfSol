#Fables of Sol
##High Concept
A world which harkens back to the traditional top-down Zelda games, filled with secrets around every corner… in space!
##Features
* You’re not limited to just one planet. While many adventure games are set in vaguely medieval settings, our game is set in the distant future where space travel is commonplace.
* You can land your ship on a planet and explore it in a top-down view, finding dungeons, filled with enemies, puzzles, and treasures. Find upgrades for your ship to travel to other planets or even other galaxies.
* Different planets have different themes. Planets close to the sun are scorching deserts, and planets on the outer edge of the solar system are freezing ice worlds.
* No boring tutorials. Many modern adventure games (Including the Zelda series itself) have become bogged down with lengthy tutorials, meaning a player might spend multiple hours being told information about the game, instead of getting to figure it out for themselves. Our game is a throwback to the time when tutorials were built into the gameplay itself.
* Secrets everywhere! One of the most enjoyable aspects of a videogame is discovering something and getting that feeling that you’ve actually encountered something most other players will never see.
* Newer 2.5D graphics. Taking advantage of higher power machines, we aren’t limited to rendering 2D sprites. instead, we can use 3D models for characters and objects without compromising that traditional and enjoyable top-down gameplay.
* Equipment based scaling, where the equipment determines a player’s ability to continue on in the storyline.
